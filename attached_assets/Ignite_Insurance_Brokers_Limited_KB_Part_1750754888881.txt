Source: https://igniteinsurance.uk/some-of-the-common-reasons-insurance-claims-get-refused/

Some of the common reasons Insurance Claims get refused Some of the most common claim refusals in general are not disclosing any previous Bankruptcy’s, County Court Judgments (CCJ’s) and Criminal Convictions – these must always be disclosed to Insurers/Brokers as these will in most cases invalidate any type of insurance policy, unless they are spent under the rehabilitation act. They fall under what is called a ‘Material Fact.’ There are specialist insurers out there that can cover this type of history and we can help you with this too. If we now focus on our first Product specific area and that’s Motor/Fleet Insurance and some examples are: Vehicle keys left in the ignition/Not properly securing them – Insurers have the right to refuse your claim if you have not taken reasonable steps to secure your vehicle keys. Always ensure they are kept securely and out of view from a possible third party. Not disclosing previous claims/convictions – this may also invalidate cover or depending on the type of conviction(s), the insurer may charge an additional premium/impose additional terms on the policy instead of refusing the claim but not worth taking the risk. You should disclose all previous claims/convictions unless they are over the disclosing period (This can vary from insurer to insurer so worth checking!) Any driver policies – usually they have brackets, Over 21/25/30 years old and an upper age limit 65/70/75 years old – you must ensure that they fit into this category. If the driver has previous claims/convictions, they still need to be disclosed to the insurer before they are allowed to drive. Some insurers will also insist that the driver is an Employee – another part of the policy that you should understand before allowing someone to drive. Overnight parking post code – you must disclose all of the postcodes where your fleet of vehicles are kept overnight. Depending on the insurer/number of vehicles, insurers will likely charge you on the higher rated postcode for the reason that is where the majority of a Theft/Malicious Damage risk is. Please also note that postcodes can vary drastically even if its just around the corner, so for instance lets take our postcode of SS14 3HX and this may be much different than SS14 3HG even though its 2 minutes up the road! That’s all for this post, keep checking in as we update with the next product very soon.

Liability Insurance Claims and some examples of why claims may be refused Liability Insurance Claims and some examples of why claims may be refused Welcome to the second post in our series of reasons why insurance claims can get refused. The last post concentrated on Motor/Fleet Insurance and for this post we are looking at general Liability Insurance policies. Number of Employees and Sub-Contractors / Annual Turnover It is important that these are correct when taking out insurance, getting this information wrong can lead to under insurance/claims or policy voidance and is also fraudulent if done with intent. Employee/Contractor numbers and turnover are a major rating factor for Public & Employers Liability which is why they must be accurate (Or as accurate as can be if estimating for the future 12 months) Height/Depth Work If you are carrying out work at height or depth, this must be disclosed to the insurer along with confirmation of how you achieve the height (Scaffolding, Scissor Lift etc) to ensure cover is given. Some insurers won’t cover height in excess of 10 metres and depth in excess of 1 metre which is why it’s important to disclose this information so that you get the right insurer with the right cover to protect you and your employees/contractors in the event an accident happens. Heat Work This is one of the biggest claim refusals under liability insurance. If you are dealing with heat, for example a Plumber with a blow torch or a Roofer undertaking torch on felt – you must disclose it along with a percentage of use against your annual turnover and the tool that you would use to carry this out. Even if you only carry out 1 job per year, this should be disclosed to insurers. Heat work is usually the highest risk so you have more chance of having a claim from the heat work than anything else that you carry out so it is important that you inform your insurer/broker to ensure you are covered. Another thing to mention here is that upon the declaration of heat work (Dependent on what you are doing) Insurers will cover you but subject to certain clauses/conditions and these can include clauses such as: • Having a watchman in place whilst you undertake the Heat work • Making sure the area you are working in hasn’t got combustible materials/flammable liquids etc • Ensuring there are fire extinguishers within reaching distance • The area you have worked in can’t be left unattended for a period of 1 hour to make sure a fire doesn’t start due to the excess heat If you don’t comply with the clauses set on your policy, chances are your insurer will not pay a claim leaving you to pay the claim along with solicitor and court fees. Policy Conditions/Clauses/Endorsements Most Liability policies will have some sort of condition or clause attached to them and these will be detailed on the Schedule. You must pay attention to them and if you think you can’t meet the requirement, speak to your Broker to see if the insurer will remove/change them and if not, look elsewhere for an alternative insurer to see if they can help instead. And lastly is Occupation This one sounds simple, you tell the Broker or Insurer that you carry out Building work and this is typically what your Schedule would say. But if you deviate away from just general building, the additional occupations need to be disclosed too. As an example, if you are a Builder but you also replace the odd roof tile or repair pipes in a sink, you are now roofing and plumbing in the eyes of an insurer especially if these are carried out in isolation i.e that was the sole job and not part of an overall bigger job. It’s good practice to make sure that the Schedule details everything that you are doing. That’s it for Liability Insurance and we hope this has helped you understand Insurance a little better and what you should be looking for when obtaining insurance quotations.

Where we use third parties to process your data, these parties are known as processors of your personal data. Where there are other parties involved in underwriting or administering your insurance they may also process your data in which circumstance we will be a joint data controller of your personal data.

These grant individuals the right to understand what personal data relating to them is held, for what purpose, how it is collected and used, with whom it is shared, where it is located, to object to its processing, to have the data corrected if inaccurate, to take copies of the data and to place restrictions on it’s processing. Individuals can also request the deletion of their personal data. These rights are known as Individual Rights under the Data Protection Act 2018.

In exercising your Individual Rights, you should understand that in some situations we may be unable to fully meet your request, for example if you make a request for us to delete all your personal data, we may be required to retain some data for taxation, prevention of crime and for regulatory and other statutory purposes. You should understand that when exercising your rights, a substantial public or vital interest may take precedence over any request you make. In addition, where these interests apply, we are required by law to grant access to this data for law enforcement, legal and/or health related matters. The flow of data within the insurance sector is complex and we ask you to keep this in mind when exercising your ‘rights of access’ to your information. Where we may be reliant on other organisations to help satisfy your request this may impact on timescales. Protecting your Data We will take all appropriate technical and organisational steps to protect the confidentiality, integrity, availability and authenticity of your data, including when sharing your data within our firm, and authorised third parties.
